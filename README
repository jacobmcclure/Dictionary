1) README - (this file) a table of contents for the repository

2) Dictionary.c - executable C file for the Dictionary ADT which utilizes
   an array of pointers which all reference the head node of a linked list.
   That is, several linked lists embedded in an array, where the array itself
   contains pointers to the heads of each linked list. Collisions are handled by
   appending the new node as the tail of the linked list whose head it collided
   with.

3) Dictionary.h - header file that contains all of the function prototypes
   for Dictionary.c.

4) DictionaryTest.c - test client for Dictionary.c that checks
   functionality of all functions and structs, etc.

5) Makefile - Tool created to ease the compilation and execution of 
   Dictionary.c. Also contains a memcheck tool to check for memory leaks.
